IMDB Movie Analysis: Exploring Factors Behind Movie Success

The film industry plays a critical role in shaping global entertainment and culture. For over a century, movies have captured the imagination of audiences, driven by their creative narratives, production quality, and marketing strategies. Understanding the factors that contribute to a movie's success has profound implications for producers, marketers, and streaming platforms in an ever-evolving entertainment landscape.
Our project aims to analyze movies using two datasets: one from Kaggle, which provides comprehensive details on 1,000 top-rated IMDB movies, and another scraped from IMDB, which offers supplementary information. By merging these datasets and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), we will investigate relationships between runtime, rating, genres, and other variables, uncovering trends in viewer preferences and industry practices.

This repository includes folders with links and data for all python notebooks that we used and created for this project.
